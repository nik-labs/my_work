This respository contains examples of my professional development training artifacts and certifications. 
Specifically, the following materials include:

1. Data Science Professional Certification from Harvard University.
   I successfully completed 9 individual data science certificates and subsequently received a professional certification in Data Science. The curriculum concluded with the successful completion of two capstone projects, requiring the application of R data analysis acquired throughout the program.
   
   Curriculum Overview:
   The program covers concepts such as probability, inference, regression, and machine learning and helps you develop an essential skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with dplyr, data visualization with ggplot2, file organization with Unix/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio.
   
   

2. Python Programming Certificate in Data Structures from Michigan University.
   The program explores variables that contain collections of data like string, lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Learning how to store and represent and manipulate data collections while a program is running is an important part of learning how to program.

3. Blue Prism Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Certification in Foundations Training.
   A comprehensive introduction to the software as they create their own processes, objects and work queues, and discover how these interact with each other. Upon completion of the course, trainees are required to complete a consolidation exercise, demonstrating understanding and application of the key concepts introduced during the course

4. Blue Prism Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Certification in Practitioner Training.
   The Practitioner course addresses best practices and practical applications of an automation process lifecycle, providing a deeper level of understanding of the functions and capabilities of Blue Prism IPA software. Completing Agilify's Foundations Training is a pre-requisite.
   
5. Lean Six Sigma Black Belt (LSSBB) Certification.
   This instructor led LSSBB certification program provides the skills, tools and knowledge to be successful process improvement efforts by applying advanced Lean approaches as well as change management; leadership and program management skills which are transferable across any organization. The program is typically self-paced allowing participants up to 1 year to complete. The Lean Black Belt certification program and accompanying process delivers an immediate return on investment through a workplace improvement project requirement â€“ over the past 5 years the average savings from Black Belt projects is in excess of $1.7m per student. This program is accredited and validated against stringent external standards.
