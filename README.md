This respository contains examples of my professional development training artifacts and certifications. 
Specifically, the following materials include:

1. Data Science Professional Certification from Harvard University.
   I successfully completed 9 individual data science certificates and subsequently received a professional certification in Data Science.
   
   Curriculum Overview:
   The program covers concepts such as probability, inference, regression, and machine learning and helps you develop an essential skill set that includes R programming, data wrangling with dplyr, data visualization with ggplot2, file organization with Unix/Linux, version control with git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation with RStudio.

2. Python Programming Certificate in Data Structures from Michigan University.
   Explores variables that contain collections of data like string, lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Learning how to store and represent and manipulate data collections while a program is running is an important part of learning how to program.

3. Blue Prism Robotic Process Automation Certification in Foundations Training.
   A comprehensive introduction to the software as they create their own processes, objects and work queues, and discover how these interact with each other. Upon completion of the course, trainees are required to complete a consolidation exercise, demonstrating understanding and application of the key concepts introduced during the course

4. Blue Prism Robotic Process Automation Certification in Practitioner Training.
   The Practitioner course addresses best practices and practical applications of an automation process lifecycle, providing a deeper level of understanding of the functions and capabilities of Blue Prism IPA software. Completing Agilify's Foundations Training is recommended.
